//The console.log unlike printing the output in browser console prints the output inside the terminal in nodejs

// const myName = 'Shamanth'
// console.log(myName)

//we can also use functions just as same as normal javascript but there are slight differences

const greet = (myName) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${myName}`)
}

greet('Shamanth')
greet('Badmaja')
